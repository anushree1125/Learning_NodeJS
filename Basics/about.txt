How does the web work(refresher)?
creating node.js server
Using node core modules
working with requests and responses(basics)
asynchronous code and the event loop


1. How the web works?
User/Client(browser) 
-- entering http://mypage.com 
-- [Domain Lookup]
-- client send request to Server[at some ip address] 
-- Our code to spin up server[nodejs, php, asp.net]
-- Response sent from server[may be html, includes header footer in res object]


HTTPS: has ssl encryption

app.js ->main file

CORE MODULES 
// http https fs path

LIFECYCLE
//server in nodejs uses only one thread it uses event loop concept which is always available
//super fast in handling multiple requests
// in background uses multiple threads
//create server creates a server which do not end. Ends on process.exit -> hard exits the process

UNDERSTANDING REQUESTS
//req is request object
//contains header- metadata
//interesting fields-> req.url, req.method, req.headers
//url is everything after localhost:3000/(...)

SENDING RESPONSE
// inspect - network[all] - localhost/test - headers

REQUEST AND RESPONSE HEADERS
// https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Reference/Headers

ROUTING REQUESTS

PARSING REQUEST DATA
// Stream and Buffers
// form send request with a req body as a key value pairs
